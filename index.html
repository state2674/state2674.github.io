<h3>Combat Rules</h3>
<ol>
  <li>No attacking, rallying, or scouting NAP alliances, including their academies, cities, headquarters, and banners.</li>
  <li>No attacking gathering tiles outside of designated events (Brothers In Arms).</li>
  <li>Do not gather in another alliance's hive. Attacks on gathering tiles are allowed in this case.</li>
  <li>No third-party interference (e.g. players switching alliances to assist) or city attacks during facility battles.</li>
  <li>Only the assigned NAP alliance may attack a stronghold or fortress. No other player or alliance should touch it.</li>
  <li>No solo attack on fortresses or strongholds.</li>
  <li>The presidency will rotate among all NAP alliances. The selection method is up to each alliance.</li>
  <li>The president must activate presidential skills during event-aligned days or be removed from rotation until NAP votes otherwise.</li>
  <li>The president is a servant for the state, not a ruler and should always follow what NAP agrees upon.</li>
  <li>Violating NAP rules may result in presidential punishment, compensation, troop loss, removal from a NAP alliance, or removal from NAP entirely.</li>
  <li>Players cannot leave NAP, break rules, and rejoin NAP. Any attempt to bypass rules will lead to punishment.</li>
  <li>Once NAP agrees to punish a player, the alliance occupying the player must comply or forfeit their position in NAP.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Alliance Rules</h3>
<ol start="13">
  <li>Each NAP alliance can designate only 1 academy alliance.</li>
  <li>The SvS designated alliance is protected by NAP.</li>
  <li>No poaching players from NAP alliances.</li>
  <li>NAP includes the top 6 alliances, their academies, and the SvS alliance.</li>
  <li>Each NAP alliance will have a single representative that will vote for the whole alliance.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Facility & Banner Rules</h3>

  <li>Follow agreed rotation schedules for fortresses and strongholds.</li>
  <li>Strongholds and fortresses will be distributed after SvS preparation, based on preparation rankings.</li>
